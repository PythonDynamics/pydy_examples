This example is the symbolic equations of motions derivation of a three
link conical pendulum.
The links of the pendulum are also considered to have mass, and are represented
as RigidBodies. The the end points of the links are represented by Particles.
The pendulum has six degrees of freedom.

To run this program type in terminal:

python three_link_pendulum.py
